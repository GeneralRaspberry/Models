## Future Directions

This simulator provides a foundation for exploring how transmission emerges from individual behavior rather than imposed mixing assumptions. Several extensions are of particular interest:

Introducing autonomous behavioral responses (e.g., avoidance, clustering, adaptive movement) to study how local decision-making reshapes epidemic dynamics.

Empirically estimating the reproduction number through secondary infections rather than relying solely on theoretical approximations.

Exploring density-dependent versus frequency-dependent transmission by varying spatial scale.

Incorporating heterogeneous contact patterns to examine superspreading behavior.

The broader aim is to investigate how complex population-level outcomes arise from simple agent rules.

This project forms part of a broader exploration into how population-level dynamics emerge from individual behavioral rules, with applications spanning epidemiology, complex adaptive systems, and decision-support modelling.
