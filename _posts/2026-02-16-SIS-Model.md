### Mechanistic Spatial SIS Model

A spatially explicit stochastic SIS epidemic model is implemented on a two-dimensional domain with toroidal topology, ensuring no boundary effects.

Individuals are introduced as either susceptible (grey) or infected (red) and move continuously throughout the environment. Transmission emerges mechanistically through proximal contact between hosts rather than being imposed through a mass-action assumption i.e. infectious status does not influence transmission dynamics.

The contact rate 
𝑘
k is estimated as the average number of contacts per agent per second over the duration of the simulation. Given a transmission probability per contact 
𝑐
c, infection is determined stochastically at each encounter. Infected individuals return to susceptibility after a fixed infectious duration, allowing endemic dynamics to emerge.

From these components, the transmission coefficient is constructed as:
β=ck

and the force of infection is computed as:

𝜆=𝛽𝐼/𝑁

representing the per-capita rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection.

The simulator demonstrates that a positive transmission coefficient alone does not guarantee epidemic persistence. Instead, sustained transmission depends on the relationship:

R0=βD

where 
D is the infectious duration.

When 
𝑅0<1, transmission chains collapse and infection fades stochastically. When 
𝑅0>1, the system approaches a fluctuating endemic equilibrium characteristic of SIS dynamics, though stochastic fadeout remains possible near the threshold.

By constructing β from first principles — contact frequency and transmission probability — the model highlights how epidemic behavior emerges from the interaction between biological and behavioral processes rather than from abstract parameters alone.

This implementation was inspired by the first-principles derivation of the transmission term presented in Box 2.1 of Keeling & Rohani’s Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals.
